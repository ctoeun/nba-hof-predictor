    "# Preliminary Results and Upcoming Milestones:\n",
    "**Steps Completed:**\n",
    "- **Setup notebooks and directories:**\n",
    "    - I have used a custom function and the os library to create directories so I can store downloaded webpages and csv files. Webpages are stored in *Webpages/* and csv file are store in *csv_files/*. <br>\n",
    "- **Downloaded webpages:**\n",
    "    - So I don't have to continuously overload Basketball-Reference, I have downloaded all the pages I need and stored them in the *Webpages/* folder. All individual player pages are in Webpages/Player Director/{}-players ({} being their last initial). <br>\n",
    "- Written algorithms to extract data:\n",
    "    - To prevent from manually gathering the data I need, I have written a few algorithms to extract elements from HTML. Each algorithm is a function and runs optimally. I will later optimise the code since it takes a while to scrape, but that will come after I have finished data analysis. <br>\n",
    "- **Web scrape and cleaned data:**\n",
    "    - Using the pages I have downloaded, I have used my algorithms (as stated above) to extract necessary data. Once the data has been extracted, I have stored them into a dataframe. From there, I have gone ahead and cleaned unecessary information using pandas. <br>\n",
    "- Converted dataframes to csv files (stored csv files to folder):\n",
    "    - So you and I wouldn't have to re-run my web scraping algorithms, I have converted each dataframe to a csv file. Each csv file is stored in the *csv_files/* folder. So far, I have a csv file for all_players, retired_players, hof_players, and active_players. I am likely to add more in the future. <br>\n",
    "- Started with Data Analysis:\n",
    "    - After create each csv file, I have started trying to determine the best stats and awards that highly correlate with hall of fame status. Along with that, I have used the describe function to determine the minimum qualifications for hall of famers. More things to be added are stated below. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps To Complete:**\n",
    "- Find bare mimumum to qualify for hof:\n",
    "    - Using the describe function, I am going to check what the minimum stats for current hofs. If current active players, or retired non-hofs meet the requirement, they are placed into eligible. The same if they don't meet it, they will be ineligible. <br>\n",
    "- Create data visualizations to present findings:\n",
    "    - I will use bar and scatter plots to showcase my findings for average seasons played for hof and retired players. The visual addition will make it easier to determine requirements. Along with plots, I want to add more heat maps and matrices to showcase correlations. <br>\n",
    "- Create predictive models using regression, svm, or decision trees (k-means probably):\n",
    "    - Like the homework, I am going to add regression, svm, and decision tree models to help predict probabilities/chances of being inducted as a hof. From these methods, I will determine the which method give the best accuracy and I will use it to predict. Findings will be showcased through data visualizations. <br>\n",
    "- Write screen-cast script:\n",
    "    - To keep things organized, once I am finished with writing the code and implementing data analysis and machine learning, I am going to write a short script for the video. I will closely follow this script when giving a voice over. <br>\n",
    "- Record and edit video:\n",
    "    - Once the script is finished, I will then record the video from my PC. If I have enough time, I will try to make to make the video interesting and add elements when editing. Rather than having a boring descriptive video, I would like to add game highlights or interviews so the viewer can have a good time. (video will be around 2-3 minutes) <br>\n",
    "- Format and Submission:\n",
    "    - Before submission, I will run all programs and reformat any files as necessary."
