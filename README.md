# Objectives
What makes an NBA player one of the greatest in league history?

To answer this question and multiple others, I am going to web scrape (using *python*) the stats of recently retired and current (2021-2022 season) NBA players and train a model to predict their qualifications and probability as a future NBA Hall of Famer (and potential First Ballot inductee).

To determine which players would be considered as a Hall of Famer, I am going to look at all previous Hall of Famers who were inducted as an **NBA player**. The data I have gathered dates back to 1946.

**Questions to consider:**

- What factors make a player likely to be inducted into the Hall of Fame?
- What is the probablity of making it to the Hall of Fame for recently retired and active players?
- Do championships alone determine a players greatness, or can a player be considered an all-time great without a championship?
- What are the most common variables among current hall of famers? Which provide the strongest correlations?
- Can I create a probabilistic classification model to predict the probability a player has to be chosen as a hall of famer based only on current stats?
- Can I create binary classification model to predict which current and recently retired players are going to be first ballot inductees?
- Can both models predict who are the top 2023 Hall of Fame inductees? Can the models go a step further and predict who are first ballots? <br>

**Benefits (Learned and accomplished):**

- Used python libraries, including dataframes, beautifulsoup, mathplotlib, etc, to gather and express results scraped from [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com/).
- Gained better knowledge on python web scraping and determining which methods are best used in certain scenarios.
- Cleaned extracted data and formatted into desired dataframes and csv files.
- Explored and visualized the differences between players based on Hall of Fame status.
- Created two models with algorithms to predict a players chance of being a Hall of Famer and potential First Ballot, based on current Hall of Famers.
- Determined the most accurate models for binary and probabablistic classification.
